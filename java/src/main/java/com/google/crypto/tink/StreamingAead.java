/**
 * An interface for streaming authenticated encryption with associated data.
 *
 * <p>Streaming encryption is typically used for encrypting large plaintexts such as large files.
 * Tink may eventually contain multiple interfaces for streaming encryption depending on the
 * supported properties. This interface supports a streaming interface for symmetric encryption with
 * authentication. The underlying encryption modes are selected so that partial plaintext can be
 * obtained fast by decrypting and authenticating just a part of the ciphertext.
 *
 * <h3>Security guarantees</h3>
 *
 * <p>Instances of StreamingAead must follow the OAE2 definition as proposed in the paper "Online
 * Authenticated-Encryption and its Nonce-Reuse Misuse-Resistance" by Hoang, Reyhanitabar, Rogaway
 * and Viz√°r https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/189.pdf
 *
 * <h3>Restrictions</h3>
 *
 * <p>Encryption must be done in one session. There is no possibility to modify an existing
 * ciphertext or append to it (other than reencrypt the whole file again). One reason for this
 * restriction is the use of AES-GCM as one cipher to implement this interface. If single segments
 * are modified then this is equivalent to reusing the same IV twice, but reusing an IV twice leaks
 * an AES-GCM key. Another reason is that implementations of this interface have no protection
 * against roll-back attacks: an attacker can always try to restore a previous version of the file
 * without detection.
 *
 * <h3>Blocking vs non-blocking I/O</h3>
 *
 * <p>A channel can be in a blocking mode (i.e. always waits until the requested number of bytes
 * have been processed) or non-blocking mode (i.e. I/O operation will never block and may transfer
 * fewer bytes than were requested or possibly no bytes at all).
 *
 * <p>If the channel provided to the streaming encryption is in blocking mode then encryption and
 * decryption have the same property. That is, encryption always processes all the plaintext passed
 * in, and waits until complete segments have been written to the ciphertext channel (incomplete
 * segment, if any, is buffered). Similarly, decryption blocks until sufficiently many bytes have
 * been read from the ciphertext channel so that all the requested plaintext can be decrypted and
 * authenticated, or until the end of the plaintext has been reached, or an IOException occurred.
 *
 * <p>If the channel provided to the streaming encryption is in non-blocking mode, then encryption
 * and decryption are also non-blocking. Since encryption and decryption is done in segments it is
 * possible that for example a call attempting to read() returns no plaintext at all even if partial
 * ciphertext was read from the underlying channel.
 *
 * <h3>Sample encryption</h3>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * StreamingAead s = ...
 * java.nio.channels.FileChannel ciphertextDestination =
 *     new FileOutputStream(ciphertextFile).getChannel();
 * byte[] aad = ...
 * WritableByteChannel encryptingChannel = s.newEncryptingChannel(ciphertextDestination, aad);
 * while ( ... ) {
 *   int r = encryptingChannel.write(buffer);
 *   ...
 * }
 * encryptingChannel.close();
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h3>Sample full decryption</h3>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * StreamingAead s = ...
 * java.nio.channels.FileChannel ciphertextSource =
 *     new FileInputStream(ciphertextFile).getChannel();
 * byte[] aad = ...
 * ReadableByteChannel decryptingChannel = s.newDecryptingChannel(ciphertextSource, aad);
 * int chunkSize = ...
 * ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(chunkSize);
 * do {
 *   buffer.clear();
 *   int cnt = decryptingChannel.read(buffer);
 *   if (cnt > 0) {
 *     // Process cnt bytes of plaintext.
 *   } else if (read == -1) {
 *     // End of plaintext detected.
 *     break;
 *   } else if (read == 0) {
 *     // No ciphertext is available at the moment.
 *   }
 * }
 * }</pre>

   *           Setting the position to a value greater than the plaintext size is legal. A later
   *           attempt to read byte will immediately return an end-of-file indication.
   *       <li>{@code int read(ByteBuffer dst)} Bytes are read starting at the channel's position,
   *           and then the position is updated with the number of bytes actually read. All bytes
   *           returned have been authenticated. If the end of the stream has been reached -1 is
   *           returned. A result of -1 is authenticated (e.g. by checking the MAC of the last
