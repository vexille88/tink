/**
 * StreamSegmentEncrypter is a helper class that encrypts individual segments of a stream.
 *
 * <p>Instances of this interfaces are passed to ...EncryptingChannel. Each instance of a segment
 * encrypter is used to encrypt one stream. Typically, constructing a new StreamSegmentEncrypter
 * results in the generation of a new symmetric key. This new symmetric key is used to encrypt the
 * segments of the stream. The key itself wrapped with or derived from the key from StreamingAead
 * instance. The wrapped key or the salt used to derive the symmetric key is part of the header.
 *
 * <p>A StreamSegmentEncrypter has a state: it keeps the number of segments encrypted so far. This
 * state is used to encrypt each segment with different parameters, so that segments in the
 * ciphertext cannot be switched.
 *
 * @since 1.1.0
